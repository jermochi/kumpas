  title: "SDG 8 and Guidance Counseling Optimization",
  paragraphs: [
    "The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) provides a holistic framework for promoting sustained, inclusive economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. In the Philippine educational system, achieving this goal is hindered by systemic challenges within guidance counseling, where professionals are burdened by administrative overload and role ambiguity. Administrative duties, such as paperwork, record-keeping, and event organization, occupy a substantial 70% of their time, eclipsing the essence of counseling itself.",
    "Our integrated tool complements these global economic goals by assessing labor market trends and guiding student career responses through dedicated feasibility and labor market analysis. By automating complex administrative tasks, the tool reallocates time back to core counseling functions, addressing the overwhelming burden that diverts counselors from engaging in direct, meaningful interactions with students. This analytical framing helps quantify labor market demands and inform career adaptation strategies, ensuring students are prepared for productive employment in line with sustainable economic development.",
    "The tool's psychological analysis capabilities translate broad student development goals into practical criteria for mental health and career readiness. Because there is a pronounced diversity in the expertise of counselors—with some lacking pivotal knowledge in child psychology—the tool helps ensure consistency and quality in counseling services across institutions. This standardized, data-driven approach also helps navigate deep-seated cultural barriers and hierarchical structures that traditionally make Filipino youths hesitant to share their perspectives with adult counselors.",
    "At the organizational level, this technological integration provides a structured framework to advocate for the counseling profession and address the pervasive issue of low remuneration. With entry-level salaries ranging from 17,000 to 20,000 PHP, the current compensation does not align with the importance and impact of the counseling role. Together, these systemic changes—redefining administrative structures, implementing standardized technological tools, and demanding equitable compensation—supply the high-level principles and management systems that ground a comprehensive sustainability assessment for Philippine education."
